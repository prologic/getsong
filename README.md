This is a simple library that utilizes the [rylio/ytdl YouTube downloader](https://github.com/rylio/ytdl) and [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to get almost any mp3 of a song that you want to listen to. I wrote this so I could [download mp3s of my favorite Spotify playlists](https://github.com/prologic/spotifydownload). 


**Disclaimer:** Downloading copyright songs may be illegal in your country. This tool is for educational purposes only and was created only to show how YouTubes's API can be used to download music. Please support the artists by buying their music.

## Install
